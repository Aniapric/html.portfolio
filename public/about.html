<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Ania, I'm a 17 year old girl living in a small town in Romania. I have taken an interest in web development as I do want to go to a computer science university and I study C++.</p>

<p>I am trying to get better in this field and web development really fascinates me and I really consider following this path as my career. Unfortunately, I don't have much spare time because I have important exams coming up that are required for entering university in my country so I study a lot</p>

<p> Apart from school, I have interests like any other teenager. I've been studying japanese for the past 2 years and I' m looking forward to take my N3 exam as soon as possible. I am a sociable person and I am proud to say that I've lived my teenage years with as may experiences as I could. I have a fun friend group and I love my friends! I find comfort in music and I can't really go on a walk without my earphones. I like my time alone and going on walks by myself. I lovee coffe and coffe shops!. I think it's important to excercise on a daily basis so I try to include it in my life as much as I can.</p>
